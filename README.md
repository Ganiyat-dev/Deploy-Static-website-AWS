### Deploy-Static-website-AWS


In this project, I successfully deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The steps are as follows:

1. I created a public s3 bucket
2. configured the s3 bucket created for website hosting
3. congifured the bucket policy that makes the contents in the s3 buckets to be accessible to the public
4. Then to speed up contents distribution, I used AWS's content distribution network service: CLoudFront.

Here is the endpoint URL for the website: https://d1t3kj31fc4i9r.cloudfront.net/
